### Conventions

This project observes the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standard and has automated tooling in place to enforce it. Please do not bypass the commit hooks; if you are committing a change that warrants bypassing the linting configuration, use an [Eslint magic comment](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#disabling-rules-with-inline-comments).

Coding style doesn't need to accord to some sort of draconian mandate; do your thing - but I appreciate efforts to keep submissions aligned with the existing work. This helps keep the project neat, organized, and accessible to future contributors.
